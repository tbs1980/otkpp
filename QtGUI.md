# Introduction #

OTK++ implements Qt4-based graphical user interface for demonstration purposes. All algorithms implemented in OTK++ are available via the GUI. However, it can only handle functions of two variables.

<h1>Quick reference</h1>

<h2>Problem setup and constraints <code>[1]</code></h2>

The user can either specify a symbolic expression or a predefined test function. A symbolic function expression may contain basic arithmetic operations and elementary functions supported by libmatheval. The list of predefined test functions contains test problems given by More, Garbow and Hillstr√∂m(1981). The expressions of these function consist of sums of squared terms, and the number of summation terms is given with the m-parameter. When you have finished choosing the objective function, click <b>Update</b> to apply the changes.<br>
<br>
Rectangular constraints for the problem can be specified by clicking the <b>Pick</b> button and dragging on the plotting area <code>[6]</code>. They can also be entered manually to the text fields. Press <b>Update</b> to apply the entered values. <b>Deactivate</b> clears previously specified constraints.<br>
<br>
<h2>Solver setup and starting point <code>[2]</code></h2>

The starting point can be picked from the plotting area after activating the picking tool by pressing <b>Pick</b>. Select the algorithm to use from the combo box.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b>: Specifying the stopping criterion does not work with the current version.<br>
<br>
<h2>Results summary <code>[3]</code></h2>

A summary of the results of the iteration is shown here. If several iteration plots are drawn, you can pick them from the plotting area <code>[6]</code> after pressing <b>Pick</b>. <b>Deselect</b> clears any selections, and <b>Remove selected</b> removes the selected iteration plot from the plotting area.<br>
<br>
<h2>Picking iterates and search lines <code>[4]</code></h2>

Iterates and search lines can be picked from the iteration plot. Pressing the <b>Pick</b> button activates the picking tool. Only one iterate or search line can be picked at a time. The <b>Deselect</b> buttons clear any selected iterates or search lines. The coordinates of the selected iterate and the corresponding function value and gradient norm are shown. For a selected search line, the objective function value along the search direction is also plotted as a function of step length.<br>
<br>
<h2>Plotting utilities <code>[5]</code></h2>

Plotting ranges can be entered manually in the text boxes and clicking the <b>Update</b> button. The plotting ranges can also be adjusted with zooming and panning tools: try the <b>zoom out</b>, <b>zoom in</b> and <b>pan</b> buttons. <b>Clear</b> removes any iterates or selections from the plot. Plots can also be saved in pdf format by clicking the <b>Save...</b> button.<br>
<br>
<h2>Plotting area <code>[6]</code></h2>

If <b>contour</b> is selected from the plot type button, this widget draws the contour plot of the objective function and iteration paths drawn on top of them. If the plotting type is <b>surface</b>, this widget shows a 3d surface of the objective function.<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> The 3d plotting widget requires OpenGL support.
